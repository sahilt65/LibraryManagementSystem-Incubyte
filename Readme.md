1) **Add Books:** Users can add new books to the library with a unique ISBN, title, author, and publication year.
2) **Borrow Books:** Users can borrow books from the library, provided they are available.
3) **Return Books:** Users can return borrowed books to the library.
4) **View Available Books:** Users can view a list of all books currently available in the library.
